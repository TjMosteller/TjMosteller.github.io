        <p> The majority of my time in the workforce was spent in various restaurants. I spent about six years, working
            in them altogether. During my time spent in restaurants I have worked as a cashier, a host, a dishwasher, a
            cook, and a team lead. The following list shows where I have worked in chronological order </p>

            <!-- created an unordered list to list prior jobs, then created li elements for each instance
                 of a prior job -->
        <ul id="job_list">
            <li> Subway -cashier, line “cook” </li>
            <li> Denny’s - host, dishwasher, cook </li>
            <li> Applebee’s - cook, team lead </li>
            <li> R’ Corner Bar & Grill - cook </li>
            <li> 28/65 Brewhouse - cook, team lead </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- pasted main content from work experience_text.txt inside of section and added a paragraph element -->
        <p> Along with my experience in restaurant I have a lot of experience in manual labor. I have done a lot of odd
            jobs including landscaping, cutting down trees, painting, tiling, roofing, and some construction. I have
            also been certified to operate both a pallet jack and a forklift, and have a lot of experience with both
            loading and unloading trucks with a pallet jack, as well as auditing the shipments.</p>
